After thinking about what I wanted to do, finally came upon the idea of doing something fun with Conway's The Game of Life. The idea is to take some photograph, separate the background from the foreground (likely I'll simply greyscale the image and use the average color value as the threshold value), then using the set pixels as the initial live state of each cell. I'm thinking about just using the original color of each pixel as the color of each live cell, but I also thought about averaging or blending the colors of each neighboring cell. Another possibility is to use the average color in the image for all live cells, as well as possibly using a 3-4 value color pallet for the values throughout.
