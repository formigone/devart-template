Got a simple website up explaining the project, as well as the main set up for the project. The idea is to only have two pages: *About* and *Create Life*. The *Create Life* page will have an input field where a path to an image is entered, and the main application will then execute.

The application is hosted in AppEngine, and uses Google Closure tools. It also uses Twitter Bootstrap 3 on the UI.
