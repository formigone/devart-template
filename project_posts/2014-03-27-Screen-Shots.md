Game of Life
------------
Here are some screenshots of a few generations from a randomly seeded game world. Life cells are red (with the alpha channel only partially filled). In the next generation, a dead cell that used to be alive is filled with another color with an alpha channel. Dead cells follow the pattern, but with a darker color. As the generations go by, the color that represents dead cells decreases its alpha levels, so that the world looks darker.
