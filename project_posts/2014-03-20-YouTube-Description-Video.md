Conway's Game of Life
---------------------
A cellular automaton that models life based on 4 simple rules. The game is zero-player, meaning that its rules keep the game going, with the only input necessary being the initial seeding of the board.


Rules
-----

 1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
 2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
 3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
 4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
